## Standardized Testing Participation Exploration

# Problem Statement:
Suppose that the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - seeks to improve the participation rate of its exams. Your presentation should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use, at minimum, the provided data to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rates of these exams.

# Conclusion:
It was found that SAT and ACT participation rates are strongly, negatively correlated, implying that when the SAT participation rate is high for a given state, that state's ACT participation rate will be low, and vice versa. Examining the State of Arkansas, we see this trend as 100% of the students take the ACT and 3% take the SAT. This is because the state of Arkansas offers the ACT test for free, which is actually quite common throughout the country, as the ACT is content based and has contracted with some states to use it as a statewide assessment. Thus, to increase the participation rate of the SAT, the college board should seek to make the SAT more content based, and seek to contract with individual states to make it their standard statewide assessment.

# Technologies Used:
Python was used for statistical analysis and for plotting. Tableau was used to create a heat-map of participation rates for both the SAT and ACT in the United States.
